This repository shows that I successfully finished the Bash Battle Arena, a special command-line game designed to help people get better at Bash scripting. From simple file tasks to more intricate system operations, the game offers a progression of challenges.

I decided to take on this project to test my understanding of Bash. My solutions for every mission are in this repository, which highlights the effort I put into finishing the game and honing my scripting abilities in the process.
